# Project Name: Ounje (means "FOOD" in my local dialect)

## Introduction

Welcome to the Ounje! After spending months in tutorial hell, I decided to dive headfirst into learning by doing. This project is a culmination of my journey through React, Axios, React Icons, and the MealDB API.

## Motivation

The age-old adage "learn by doing" finally made sense, so I embarked on a mission to build something tangible. The goal? To explore React more, use the power of Axios to consume APIs, and sprinkle in some motion with framer-motion.

## Features

- **Dynamic Search**: Explore a vast database of meals using dynamic search functionality.
- **Random Meal Generator**: Feeling indecisive? Let the random meal generator choose for you.
- **Country-wise Dish Discovery**: Dive into the culinary world by discovering dishes based on their country of origin.
- **Favorites**: Save your favorite meals for later exploration.
- **Smooth Animations**: Enjoy seamless transitions and animations powered by framer-motion.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: The cornerstone of the project, providing a robust framework for building interactive user interfaces.
- **Axios**: Used for making HTTP requests to fetch data from the MealDB API.
- **React Icons**: Sprinkled throughout the project to add visual flair and intuitive iconography.
- **MealDB API**: A treasure trove of culinary data, providing access to a vast collection of meals, ingredients, and categories.
- **Framer Motion**: Elevating the user experience with fluid animations and delightful transitions.

## Usage

- Explore the vast collection of meals by searching, filtering, or browsing by country or category.
- Discover new dishes with the random meal generator.
- Save your favorite meals for quick access and future reference.
- Enjoy seamless transitions and fluid animations throughout the application.

## Acknowledgements

A big shoutout to the MealDB team for providing such an extensive and user-friendly API. Special thanks to the React and framer-motion communities for their invaluable resources and support.
